********************************************************************************
Linux Image V2.0 Beta 1 (June 26, 2013)
- U-Boot:
  - initial integration
  - integrate NVIDIA partition table parsing incl. Toradex Apalis configuration block
  - adjust available amount of memory
  - activate DVI-D framebuffer console
  - increase CPU frequency at boot
  - decrease boot delay
  - fix overflow in HCD conversion
- Linux kernel:
  - hack to make newer SD cards work by adding a quirk for lack of 1.8v support
  - revise Ethernet MAC address assignment
  - fix PCIe AXI response decoding errors
  - fix PCIe reset issue
  - remove spurious tegra_aes_device
  - video4linux adv7180 and max9526 integration
  - fix PCIe by forcing GEN1 speed
  - set board local critical temperature to 95Â°C
  - hack to avoid 24 Hz mode in X resulting in no display at all
  - silence extensive HDMI HDA audio messages
- rootfs / oe-core:
  - update to latest git revision for kernel and u-boot
  - extend rootfs partition on eMMC to its full partition size on first boot
  - unified update procedure for all T20/T30
  - limit journal size
  - nv-binaries: update to L4T R16.3
  - added packages: gstreamer deinterlacer, scrot
  - lxterminal, florence: fix garbled titlebar

- sources git.toradex.com tag Apalis_T30_LinuxImageV2.0Beta1_20130626

Known Issues:
- We are in an early Beta state, not all functions are tested.
- If a a monitor is connected to DVI, the kernel sometime hangs when the 
  display controller DC1 is initialised. -> reboot required. 
- LVDS aka TFTLCD resolution hard-coded in kernel to full HD resolution, 
  comments with timings for other resolutions provided
- lxappearance is segfaulting upon start
- connecting an analogue mic to the on module codec resets the codec, so that 
  neither headphone out nor mic in works anymore. Workaround: Have mic 
  connected before boot or change the output source between DAC/LineIn
- certain low-speed USB devices might not get detected
- on first boot the resizing process adversely affects system performance for 
  the first few minutes until completed

- Linux kernel:
  - first release
- oe-core:
  - first release
- sources git.toradex.com tag Apalis_T30_LinuxImageV2.0Alpha1_20130315

Known Issues:
- We are in an early Alpha state, not all functions are tested.
- If a a monitor is connected to DVI, the kernel sometime hangs when the 
  display controller DC1 is initialised. -> reboot required. 
- LVDS aka TFTLCD resolution hard-coded in kernel to full HD resolution, 
  comments with timings for other resolutions provided

  connected before boot or change the output source between DAC/LineIn

********************************************************************************
Notes:
- 115200 baud serial debug console on UARTA aka UART1 (EvalBoard lower X28 resp. X29 depending on JP10/12) without any handshake
- user account: root with empty password
- ext3 root file system
- opkg package manager
- HDMI: not all pixel clock frequencies allow for HDMI audio
- CRT: the T30 internal video DAC output is unsupported by NVIDIA's L4T Linux SW stack
- Linux host used for recovery mode flashing requires proper 32-bit execution environment (e.g. install ia32-libs on 64-bit Ubuntu)

eMMC Boot: Apalis T30 V1.0a and V1.0b (Sample)
**********************************************

Initial Preparation:
- download and extract T30_LinuxImageVx.yz.tar.bz2 package with root permissions

Flash eMMC:
- EvalBoard V1.0a
  - connect USB micro A/B (X49) or USB B (X50) to development workstation using micro or regular USB cable
  - connect serial debug console to lower X28 or X29 using null modem RS-232 or regular USB cable
  - enter recovery mode:
    - Eboot (e.g. transitioning from WEC):
      - 115200 baud without any handshake
      - hold space key while applying power or resetting
      - press x to enter command mode
      - use 'reboot rcm' command
    - U-Boot (e.g. updating Embedded Linux):
      - 115200 baud without any handshake
      - apply power or reset
      - hit any key to stop auto booting
      - use 'enterrcm' command
  - for more information about recovery mode please consult Apalis T30 datasheet chapter 6
- run update.sh script

Boot from eMMC:
- EvalBoard V1.0a
- power cycle
- upon first boot post-install scripts are run which takes around 2 minutes, please be patient
