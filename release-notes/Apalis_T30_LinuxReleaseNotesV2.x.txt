Release Notes:  Linux Image V2.x for Apalis T30
***********************************************

Contents:
- U-Boot 2011.06 boot loader
- Linux 3.1.10 kernel, based on NVIDIA's Linux for Tegra (L4T) release R16.4
- OpenEmbedded oe-core 2013.06 based root file system, using LXDE desktop environment

Licensing:
- proprietary multimedia codecs included for evaluation purpose only
- customer required to obtain proper re-distribution license

********************************************************************************
Linux Image V2.1 Beta 3 (March 18, 2014)
- U-Boot:
  - Enable hardware boot partition support (via 'mmc dev [dev] [part]' command).
  - Get rid of the spurious 'video=tegrafb' kernel boot argument and add
    'noatime' to the usbargs.
- Linux kernel:
  - Initialise high speed UART with lower default baudrate to avoid issues.
  - Merge with NVIDIA's latest L4T R16.4 kernel.
  - Fix the disabling of PCIe GEN2 capabilities.
  - Added OmniVision OV7670 and Texas Instruments TVP5150 V4L2 drivers.
  - Added initial Aptina AS0260 V4L2 driver.
  - Solved low framerate issue with analogue cameras.
- rootfs / oe-core:
  - nv-binaries: update to L4T R16.4
  - Added gst-plugins-good-jpeg
- sources git.toradex.com tag Apalis_T30_LinuxImageV2.1Beta3_20140318

Known Issues:
- connecting an analogue mic to the on module codec resets the codec, so that 
    neither headphone out nor mic in works anymore. Workaround: Have mic 
    connected before boot or change the output source between DAC/LineIn
- certain low-speed USB devices might not get detected
- on first boot the resizing process adversely affects system performance for 
    the first few minutes until completed

********************************************************************************
Linux Image V2.1 Beta 2 (February 6, 2014)
- U-Boot:
  - Add more UART configurations to the device trees allowing easy switching of
    the console UART port by changing the UART base address of the console node
    within the device tree.
  - Fix EHCI periodic list handling.
  - Add default VESA VGA vidargs for our now modedb enabled kernel. This allows
    easy specifying an alternate parallel RGB resolution.
  - Fix usbboot option to be more in-line with how we do optional MMC/SD card
    boot on Colibri VF50/VF61. Loads the uimage kernel from the first partition
    being formatted as VFAT and instructs the kernel to mount the second
    partition formatted as ext3 as root file system.
- Linux kernel:
  - Use TPS6591X IRQ base define to calculate correct IRQ number.
  - Remove vdd_hdmi_con regulator from dc1 since we don't have a dedicated
    regulator for this connector on our baseboards.
  - Fix SATA suspend/resume by adding avdd_plle regulator.
  - Fix HDMI suspend/resume by avoiding division by zero oops.
  - Add GPIO keyboard configuration.
  - Use integer for root_bus_nr in Tegra PCIe driver.
  - Add STMPE ADC driver using IIO framework
    (see http://developer.toradex.com/knowledge-base/adc-(linux)).
  - Use modedb to specify framebuffer resolution (see
    http://developer.toradex.com/knowledge-base/framebuffer-(linux) and
    http://developer.toradex.com/knowledge-base/x-server-(linux)).
  - Check null pointers for sysfs calls.
  - Hack to avoid 24 Hz mode in X resulting in no display at all. This has been
    encountered using e.g. a Samsung SyncMaster F2380 if connected by HDMI.
  - Add kernel parameters to change RGB clock polarity.
  - Re-work Fusion multi-touch touchscreen driver.
  - Before updating modes on HDMI hotplug, check if framebuffer is registered
    at all. This allows to disable framebuffers completely.
- rootfs / oe-core:
  - Fix build and texinfo errors for stress.
  - Add sections for both monitor outputs to xorg.conf. Add example
    configuration to disable an output as well as select preferred mode.
  - Add entry for fusion touchscreen driver to xorg.conf.
  - Add fstrim from util-linux.
  - Add kernel module for fusion touch screens (see
    http://developer.toradex.com/knowledge-base/capacitive-multi-touch-display-(linux)).
  - burnflash: Account for fs overhead and many files.

********************************************************************************
Linux Image V2.1 Beta 1 (October 22, 2013)
- U-Boot:
  - Fix possible uninitialised array member issue in serial number to
      hexadecimal coded decimal conversion routine (e.g. as used for
      /proc/cpuinfo in Linux).
  - Fix Linux USB OTG1 behaviour by not enabling USBO1_EN during
      boot as USB host functionality on OTG1 port is anyway broken under U-Boot.
- Linux kernel:
  - Fix several HDMI hang issues.
  - Exported Apalis GPIOs via SYSFS (see /sys/class/gpio).
  - Support default watchdog API (see
      http://developer.toradex.com/knowledge-base/watchdog-(linux)).
  - Disable magic SysRq key configuration as this is not only a potential
       security thread but can cause serious trouble if for some reason UART pins
       are left floating and therefore cause unexpected break conditions.
  - HDMI: Retry EDID reads up to 4 times until failing.

- rootfs / oe-core:
  - OpenEmbedded: layers updated to dylan
      xserver update to version 1.14
      gtk+ updated to 2.24.15
      firefox update to 10.0.11esr
      connman now has a command line tool, connmanctl
      split the meta-lxde layer from oe-tworaz and serve it from
        git.toradex.com
  - NEON enabled build
  - hdmi: add udev rule to start an X output on hotplug
  - feed-config: use the new feed armv7ahf-vfp-neon
  - evdev: backport V2.8.1 from dora to get a fix for multitouch events
  - burnflash: script for configblock generation
  - added packages: ethtool
  - burnflash: add sanity checks

  - connect USB micro A/B (X9) to development workstation using regular micro USB cable
  - make sure JP2 is removed and nothing is connected to the lower USB host port X8
  - optionally assemble resistor R90 instead of R91 so SW3 can be used as recovery mode switch
  - for more information please consult Ixora datasheet section 3.3 and chapter 4
- enter recovery mode:
  - EvalBoard with Mezzanine press recovery mode SW2 while applying power
  - Ixora press SW3 while applying power (requires R90 assembly option noted above)
  - Eboot (e.g. transitioning from WEC):
    - 115200 baud without any handshake
    - hold space key while applying power or resetting
    - press x to enter command mode
    - use 'reboot rcm' command
  - U-Boot (e.g. updating Embedded Linux):
    - 115200 baud without any handshake
    - apply power or reset
    - hit any key to stop auto booting
    - use 'enterrcm' command
  - for more information about recovery mode please consult Apalis T30 datasheet chapter 6
- run update.sh script

Boot from eMMC:
- EvalBoard V1.0a or Ixora V1.0a
- power cycle
- upon first boot post-install scripts are run which takes around 2 minutes, please be patient
