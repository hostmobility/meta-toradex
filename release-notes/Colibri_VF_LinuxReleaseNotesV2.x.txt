Known Issues:
- If the module does not boot remove all displays connected to HSYNC, VSYNC and reset.
  (This has been observed on an Evaluation Board V2.1)
- Analogue audio is not working on the Colibri VF61
- An input on UART_A during bootup can lead to a hang (stuck at "rtc-ds1307 0-0068: hctosys: unable to
  read the hardware clock"). Make sure UART_A is connected before powering up and not written to.

********************************************************************************
Linux Image V2.1 Beta 2 (November 29, 2013)

  - Implement module type (e.g. VF50 vs. VF61) auto detection based on L2 cache availability.
  - Set specific ARM core clock (e.g. 400 vs. 500 MHz) as well as Linux machine id number.
  - Rename configuration to colibri_vf to be universally used for Colibri VF50 as well as VF61.
- Linux kernel:
  - Various ADC resp. VF50 touch improvements/fixes.
  - Implement internal temperature sensor exposed via /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon0/device/temp1_input.
  - Fix VESA VGA display timing.

    - 800x600@60
    - 1024x600@60 (e.g. TouchRevolution Fusion 10)

  - Allow for 396 as well as 500 MHz A5 core frequency.
  - Add the Colibri VF61 machine id and its corresponding machine definition.
  - Rename configuration to colibri_vf to be universally used for Colibri VF50 as well as VF61.
  - Enable watchdog configuration.
  - Fix Freescale's magic daisy chain aka select input IOMUX stuff.
  - Fix pixel clock polarity.
- rootfs / oe-core:
  - Use branch 'LinuxImageV2.1' in toradex-bsp-platform.git 
  - Fix recipe to follow the changed khronos headers checksum
  - Rename machine to colibri-vf to be universally used for Colibri VF50 as well as VF61
  - Unify files for use with VF50/VF61 or add VF61 specific ones

- U-Boot:
  - Fix long standing boot hang issue introduced by Freescale's Vybrid 1.1 silicon.

      hexadecimal coded decimal conversion routine (e.g. as used for
      /proc/cpuinfo in Linux).

  - Integrate config block handling
  - Increase the available space for the U-Boot binary to half a megabyte by booting from gfxRAM rather than sysRAM0.
  - Initial support based off Timesys' implementation for Freescale's Vybrid Tower System TWR-VF65GS10:
    - New machine ID.

       are left floating and therefore cause unexpected break conditions.
  - Decrease DMA zone size configuration.
  - Enable tmpfs POSIX ACL configuration.
  - Re-enable L2 cache kernel configuration as it is now only enabled if actually present on chip.
  - Implement resistive touch screen driver using ADCs and GPIOs.

      configure DCU for VESA VGA with a 30 MHz pixel clock
  - Enable CPU idle, NEON, ASRC and printk time.
  - Initial support based off Timesys' implementation for Freescale's Vybrid Tower System TWR-VF65GS10:
    - New machine ID.
    - FEC1 only.
    - ESDHC2 only with card detect interrupt.
    - PLL5 based RMII clocking (e.g. no external crystal).
