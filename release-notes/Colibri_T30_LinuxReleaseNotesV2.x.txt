Release Notes:  Linux Image V2.x for Colibri T30
************************************************

Contents:
- U-Boot 2011.06 boot loader
- Linux 3.1.10 kernel, based on NVIDIA's Linux for Tegra (L4T) release 16-r3
- OpenEmbedded oe-core 2013.06 based root file system, using LXDE desktop environment

Licensing:
- proprietary multimedia codecs included for evaluation purpose only

********************************************************************************
Linux Image V2.1 Beta 1 (October 22, 2013)
- U-Boot:
  - Fix possible uninitialised array member issue in serial number to
      hexadecimal coded decimal conversion routine (e.g. as used for
      /proc/cpuinfo in Linux).
- Linux kernel:
  - Fix several HDMI hang issues.
  - Support default watchdog API (see
      http://developer.toradex.com/knowledge-base/watchdog-(linux)).
  - Disable magic SysRq key configuration as this is not only a potential
       security thread but can cause serious trouble if for some reason UART pins
       are left floating and therefore cause unexpected break conditions.
  - Add DDR speed definition for 400 and 800 MHz.
  - HDMI: Retry EDID reads up to 4 times until failing.

- rootfs / oe-core:
  - OpenEmbedded: layers updated to dylan
      xserver update to version 1.14
      gtk+ updated to 2.24.15
      firefox update to 10.0.11esr
      connman now has a command line tool, connmanctl
      split the meta-lxde layer from oe-tworaz and serve it from
        git.toradex.com
  - NEON enabled build
  - hdmi: add udev rule to start an X output on hotplug
  - feed-config: use the new feed armv7ahf-vfp-neon
  - evdev: backport V2.8.1 from dora to get a fix for multitouch events
  - burnflash: script for configblock generation
  - added packages: ethtool
  - burnflash: change the Colibri image names to start with Colibri
  - burnflash: add sanity checks

Known Issues:
- LVDS aka TFTLCD resolution hard-coded in kernel to VESA VGA resolution, 
    comments with timings for other resolutions provided
- connecting an analogue mic to the on module codec resets the codec, so that 
    neither headphone out nor mic in works anymore. Workaround: Have mic 
    connected before boot or change the output source between DAC/LineIn
- certain low-speed USB devices might not get detected
- on first boot the resizing process adversely affects system performance for 
    the first few minutes until completed

  old: echo y | mkfs.ext3 $@ -L arm 
  new: mkfs.ext3 -F -L arm $@

eMMC Boot: Colibri T30 V1.1b, V1.1c or V1.1d (Sample)
*****************************************************

Initial Preparation:
- download and extract Colibri_T30_LinuxImageVx.yz.tar.bz2 package with root permissions

Flash eMMC:
- EvalBoard V3.1a
  - connect USB B (X29) or USB micro A/B (X30) to development workstation using regular or micro USB cable
  - the jumper JP2 must be open
  - press and hold recovery mode switch (SW9) during power up
- Iris V1.1a
  - connect USB micro A/B (X12) to development workstation using regular micro USB cable
  - short pin 1-2 of JP1 on Iris for RECOVERY
(other carrier boards see http://developer.toradex.com/knowledge-base/colibri-recovery-mode)
- make sure that the carrier board supports USB high speed
  - Iris & EvalBoard V3.1a OK, for other carrier boards see http://developer.toradex.com/knowledge-base/usb-2.0-high-speed-%28480mbps%29 )
- apply power or reset
- run update.sh script

Boot from eMMC:
- EvalBoard V3.1a
  - do no longer press SW9
- Iris V1.1a
  - do no longer short any pins of JP1
- power cycle
- upon first boot post-install scripts are run which takes around 2 minutes, please be patient
