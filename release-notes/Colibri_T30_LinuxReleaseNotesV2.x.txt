Release Notes:  Linux Image V2.x for Colibri T30
************************************************

Contents:
- U-Boot 2011.06 boot loader
- Linux 3.1.10 kernel, based on NVIDIA's Linux for Tegra (L4T) release R16.4
- OpenEmbedded oe-core 2013.06 based root file system, using LXDE desktop environment

Licensing:
- proprietary multimedia codecs included for evaluation purpose only
- customer required to obtain proper re-distribution license

********************************************************************************
Linux Image V2.1 Beta 3 (March 18, 2014)
- U-Boot:
  - Enable hardware boot partition support (via 'mmc dev [dev] [part]' command).
  - Get rid of the spurious 'video=tegrafb' kernel boot argument and add
    'noatime' to the usbargs.
- Linux kernel:
  - Initialise high speed UART with lower default baudrate to avoid issues.
  - Merge with NVIDIA's latest L4T R16.4 kernel.
  - Added OmniVision OV7670 and Texas Instruments TVP5150 V4L2 drivers.
  - Added initial Aptina AS0260 V4L2 driver.
  - Solved low framerate issue with analogue cameras.
- rootfs / oe-core:
  - nv-binaries: update to L4T R16.4
  - Added gst-plugins-good-jpeg
- sources git.toradex.com tag Colibri_T30_LinuxImageV2.1Beta3_20140318

Known Issues:
- connecting an analogue mic to the on module codec resets the codec, so that 
    neither headphone out nor mic in works anymore. Workaround: Have mic 
    connected before boot or change the output source between DAC/LineIn
- certain low-speed USB devices might not get detected
- on first boot the resizing process adversely affects system performance for 
    the first few minutes until completed

********************************************************************************
Linux Image V2.1 Beta 2 (February 6, 2014)
- U-Boot:
  - Add more UART configurations to the device trees allowing easy switching of
    the console UART port by changing the UART base address of the console node
    within the device tree.
  - Fix EHCI periodic list handling.
  - Add default VESA VGA vidargs for our now modedb enabled kernel. This allows
    easy specifying an alternate parallel RGB resolution.
  - Fix usbboot option to be more in-line with how we do optional MMC/SD card
    boot on Colibri VF50/VF61. Loads the uimage kernel from the first partition
    being formatted as VFAT and instructs the kernel to mount the second
    partition formatted as ext3 as root file system.
- Linux kernel:
  - Use TPS6591X IRQ base define to calculate correct IRQ number.
  - Remove vdd_hdmi_con regulator from dc1 since we don't have a dedicated
    regulator for this connector on our baseboards.
  - Fix HDMI suspend/resume by avoiding division by zero oops.
  - Don't register KEY_BACK for wakeup.
  - Add STMPE ADC driver using IIO framework
    (see http://developer.toradex.com/knowledge-base/adc-(linux)).
  - Use modedb to specify framebuffer resolution (see
    http://developer.toradex.com/knowledge-base/framebuffer-(linux) and
    http://developer.toradex.com/knowledge-base/x-server-(linux)).
  - Check null pointers for sysfs calls.
  - Hack to avoid 24 Hz mode in X resulting in no display at all. This has been
    encountered using e.g. a Samsung SyncMaster F2380 if connected by HDMI.
  - Add kernel parameters to change RGB clock polarity.
  - Re-work Fusion multi-touch touchscreen driver.
  - Before updating modes on HDMI hotplug, check if framebuffer is registered
    at all. This allows to disable framebuffers completely.
- rootfs / oe-core:
  - Fix build and texinfo errors for stress.
  - Add sections for both monitor outputs to xorg.conf. Add example
    configuration to disable an output as well as select preferred mode.
  - Add entry for fusion touchscreen driver to xorg.conf.
  - Add fstrim from util-linux.
  - Add kernel module for fusion touch screens (see
    http://developer.toradex.com/knowledge-base/capacitive-multi-touch-display-(linux)).
  - burnflash: Account for fs overhead and many files.

Linux Image V2.1 Beta 1 (October 22, 2013)
- U-Boot:
  - Fix possible uninitialised array member issue in serial number to
      hexadecimal coded decimal conversion routine (e.g. as used for
      /proc/cpuinfo in Linux).
- Linux kernel:
  - Fix several HDMI hang issues.
  - Support default watchdog API (see
      http://developer.toradex.com/knowledge-base/watchdog-(linux)).
  - Disable magic SysRq key configuration as this is not only a potential
       security thread but can cause serious trouble if for some reason UART pins
       are left floating and therefore cause unexpected break conditions.
  - Add DDR speed definition for 400 and 800 MHz.
  - HDMI: Retry EDID reads up to 4 times until failing.

- rootfs / oe-core:
  - OpenEmbedded: layers updated to dylan
      xserver update to version 1.14
      gtk+ updated to 2.24.15
      firefox update to 10.0.11esr
      connman now has a command line tool, connmanctl
      split the meta-lxde layer from oe-tworaz and serve it from
        git.toradex.com

eMMC Boot: Colibri T30 V1.1b, V1.1c or V1.1d (Sample)
*****************************************************

Initial Preparation:
- download and extract Colibri_T30_LinuxImageVx.yz.tar.bz2 package with root permissions

Flash eMMC:
- EvalBoard V3.1a
  - connect USB B (X29) or USB micro A/B (X30) to development workstation using regular or micro USB cable
  - the jumper JP2 must be open
  - press and hold recovery mode switch (SW9) during power up
- Iris V1.1a
  - connect USB micro A/B (X12) to development workstation using regular micro USB cable
  - short pin 1-2 of JP1 on Iris for RECOVERY
(other carrier boards see http://developer.toradex.com/knowledge-base/colibri-recovery-mode)
- make sure that the carrier board supports USB high speed
  - Iris & EvalBoard V3.1a OK, for other carrier boards see http://developer.toradex.com/knowledge-base/usb-2.0-high-speed-%28480mbps%29 )
- apply power or reset
- run update.sh script

Boot from eMMC:
- EvalBoard V3.1a
  - do no longer press SW9
- Iris V1.1a
  - do no longer short any pins of JP1
- power cycle
- upon first boot post-install scripts are run which takes around 2 minutes, please be patient
