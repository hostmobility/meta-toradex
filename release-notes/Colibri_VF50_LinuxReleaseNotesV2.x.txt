Release Notes:  Linux Image V2.x for Colibri VF50
*************************************************

Contents:
- U-Boot 2011.12 boot loader
- Linux 3.0.15 kernel, based on Freescale TWR-VF65GS10 Timesys LinuxLink 2013-07-29
- OpenEmbedded oe-core 2013.06 based root file system, using LXDE desktop environment

********************************************************************************
Linux Image V2.1 Beta 1 (October 22, 2013)
- U-Boot:
  - Fix long standing boot hang issue introduced by Freescale's Vybrid 1.1 silicon.
  - Fix possible uninitialised array member issue in serial number to
      hexadecimal coded decimal conversion routine (e.g. as used for
      /proc/cpuinfo in Linux).
  - Migrate default NAND vs. SD card boot configuration (in-line with Colibri T20)
  - Integrate config block handling
  - Increase the available space for the U-Boot binary to half a megabyte by booting from gfxRAM rather than sysRAM0.
  - Initial support based off Timesys' implementation for Freescale's Vybrid Tower System TWR-VF65GS10:
    - New machine ID.
    - Default UART_A on SCI0.
    - ESDHC2 only.
    - 8-bit NAND.
    - No quad SPI.
    - FEC1 only.
    - Enabled command line editing.
    - PLL5 based RMII clocking (e.g. no external crystal).
    - UART_A, UART_B and UART_C I/O muxing.
- Linux kernel:
  - Hackish USBH_PEN implementation.
  - Setup memory if mem= is not passed to kernel.
  - Enable RTS/CTS on UART_A aka UART0 and UART_B aka UART2.
  - Integrate backlight using both BL_ON GPIO and PWM<A>.
  - Re-worked IOMUX pin muxing.
  - Disable magic SysRq key configuration as this is not only a potential
       security thread but can cause serious trouble if for some reason UART pins
       are left floating and therefore cause unexpected break conditions.
  - Decrease DMA zone size configuration.
  - Enable tmpfs POSIX ACL configuration.
  - Re-enable L2 cache kernel configuration as it is now only enabled if actually present on chip.
  - Implement resistive touch screen driver using ADCs and GPIOs.
  - Add Eon Silicon Solutions manufacturer ID and integrate mxc_nand platform data handling.
  - Disable NAND controller software ECC in order to use hardware ECC.
  - Enable ADC driver as well as debugfs file system.
  - Fix DCU clock rounding, set DCU clock to 150.7 MHz, increase display pin drive strength and
      configure DCU for VESA VGA with a 30 MHz pixel clock
  - Enable CPU idle, NEON, ASRC and printk time.
  - Initial support based off Timesys' implementation for Freescale's Vybrid Tower System TWR-VF65GS10:
    - New machine ID.
    - FEC1 only.
    - ESDHC2 only with card detect interrupt.
    - PLL5 based RMII clocking (e.g. no external crystal).
    - VESA VGA display timing (tested with 5.7" EDT ET057090DHU).
    - Default UART_A on SCI0.
    - UART_A and UART_C I/O muxing.
    - I2C real time clock on carrier board.
    - Early boot console support.
    - 8-bit NAND.
- rootfs / oe-core:
  - OpenEmbedded: layers from dylan
      xserver version 1.14
      gtk+ 2.24.15
      midori 0.5.0
  - NEON and hard float enabled build
  - feed-config: use the new feed armv7ahf-vfp-neon
  - evdev: backport V2.8.1 from dora to get a fix for multitouch events
  - browser: use midori
  - burnflash: script for configblock generation
  - systemd-journald: limit journal size
- sources git.toradex.com linux/u-boot branches colibri_vf tag Colibri_VF50_LinuxImageV2.1Beta1_20131022

Known Issues:
- LVDS aka TFTLCD resolution hard-coded in kernel to VESA VGA resolution.

**************************************
NAND Boot: Colibri VF50 V1.0a (Sample)
**************************************

If the boot loader in NAND got corrupted SD card boot as described further down can be used as a means of recovery.

Initial Preparation:
- download and extract Colibri_VF50_LinuxImageVx.yz.tar.bz2 package with root permissions
- use any VFAT formatted SD resp. uSD card with at least 100 MB of free space
- optionally format the SD resp. uSD card using the format_sd.sh script (warning everything will be erased)
- run update.sh script with optional -o argument pointing to mount point of above mentioned card

Flash NAND:
- EvalBoard V3.1a
  - 115200 baud serial debug console on UART0 aka FFUART (lower X25 resp. X27 depending on JP17/19) without any handshake
  - insert above prepared SD card into SD card/MMC SDIO-socket (X15)
- Iris V1.1a
  - 115200 baud serial debug console on UART0 aka FFUART (X13) without any handshake
  - insert above prepared uSD card into uSD card holder (X10)
  - apply power or reset
  - hit any key to stop auto booting
  - use 'mmc part 0 ; fatload mmc 0:1 $loadaddr flash_mmc.img ;source' commands
  - use 'run update' command

Boot from NAND:
- EvalBoard V3.1a or Iris V1.1a
- above given update command should automatically perform a soft re-boot upon successful completion
- optionally power cycle
- upon first boot post-install scripts are run which takes around 2 minutes, please be patient


*****************************************

    - pull the following X8 pins up aka to 3.3 volt with 1 k ohm resistors: 21, 27, 34 and 44
- download and extract Colibri_VF50_LinuxImageVx.yz.tar.bz2 package with root permissions

Flash SD Card:
- use any SD resp. uSD card of at least 100 MB capacity
- format and flash SD resp. uSD card using format_sd.sh script giving -d argument pointing to
    device file of SD card and -f argument (warning everything will be erased)

Boot from SD Card:
